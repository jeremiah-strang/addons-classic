## Updated RCLootCouncil to v2.19.0
*Only Classic relevant changes listed here-*
### Changes

#### Award Later
When `Award Later` and `Auto Start` both are enabled, all items are automatically awarded to the Master Looter/Group Leader for award later.

I generally don't recommend enabling `Auto Start` as you will have no control over what happens before setting the addon free to do its thing.
This is especially dangerous with `Award Later`, as ALL eligible items will be awarded automatically.  
**You have been warned.**

#### Boss Name in History
The boss name is now directly attached to items, meaning no matter when you award items the boss name should be correct in the Loot History.
This would not be the case earlier if another boss was pulled before awarding registered items.

#### Classic
The retail version will now show a chat message if installed in the Classic client and vice versa, before disabling itself.

#### Error Handler
RCLootCouncil will now log any lua errors caused by it.
This will help in debugging errors as users are no longer required to turn on scriptErrors to register them.

#### Voting Frame
When `Hide Votes` is enabled, the Voting Frame will no longer sort the list when receiving votes from other councilmembers.
Once the player has voted, the list is sorted as normal.
